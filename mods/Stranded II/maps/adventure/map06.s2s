Nyaarrgh!
I have run onto a cliff with my ship.
It looks like I must repair it to go on. But I need iron for that.
7 pieces of iron should be enough, but I will have to dive for them.
//~irondef
on:collect {
	$stored=count_stored("unit",1,85);
	if ($stored>=6){
		diary "Enough iron gathered!","maps/adventure/map06.s2s","foundiron";
		timer 0,0,1,"endmap";
	}
}

on:drop {
	skipevent;
	msg "I still need that, remember?",3;
	speech "negative";
}

//~foundiron
I have managed to find enough iron!
After a short repair, the ship is fully functionable again and I can head homewards again.
Full speed ahead!
