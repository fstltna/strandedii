I only wanted to dig out a treasure, and now this is where I am. Cruising with a pirate.
Now he has brought me to a different island, but I do not have the slightest clue what he expects me to do here!

Hohoho!
Welcome to mine pirate island!
This is where I plan my raids and repair my magnific ship, if it has been damaged in battle.
Well... actually, this is what I used to do. But some weeks ago, somebody came hither and ransacked and raided everything. They blew up my entire lighthouse! Arrr! Of course I was on a raid at that time and could not stop them, aye? I saw it when I returned. The fog was so dense that one could cut it in slices. I was doomed, because I didn't have any cuttery. Which was not the main problem; that was rather the missing lighthouse. With a big crush, I ran ashore with at least 10 knots of velocity. Hoho! I spotted my island by far too late. I expected that the lighthouse would warn me. Arrr...
Anyway, my ship is a complete wreck now. It is down there at the beach. I really am on a run of bad luck. I had not even yet got over the death of my parrot when it happened!

text=start
Harrr! Did ye not listen properly?! I am a dreadful pirate! A pirate without a ship!
Ye fool shalt help me! I need ye to build a new ship. Won't get far with the olde phantom rudder boat!
text=end
button=ok,Alright, I see. It looks like I have no choice.
button=otherway,Can't we find another way?

title=A ship
text=start
Hohoho. Thank ye for being so understanding! At least I have a new parrot now. All more that I need is a ship...
text=end
button=why,Um... what do I have to do with that?

page=otherway
title=Lighthouse
text=start
Well... We could surely also solve our problem by rebuilding the lighthouse.
Then I could send light signals to the next inhabited island and they would send help hither - per ship.
text=end
button=ok,Ahem... what shall I do?

page=ok
title=Torches
text=start
Before ye can do anything here, ye must light all torches on the island. There is a pair of firestones in my cottage. If somebody might occasionally come across, he will see us better then.
Plus, I just like fire. This is why me jacket is red. Lovely, isn't it?
text=end
button=action:close,Um... yes, sure... I'm off to work on it.

Warm and illuminated! Hoho! That is how I like it!
Let's see... er... oh, right. Ye want to get away, don't ye?
There are two ways:
Either ye help me to rebuild my lighthouse or we repair my ship.
It is up to thee to decide.
For the lighthouse I need 30 stones, for the ship 15 logs should do it.
Get the stuff and deliver it to me, then we will see how to carry on!

He is gone! Just gone!
When I slept, he must just have hopped into his phantom rudder boat and left. The jerk has imposed on my kindness! What a shameless boldness!
But... wait a minute!
Over there, he seems to have left a message for me. I should take a look at it.

Whaaa! Help!
As I try to grab the message, suddenly I hear a loud cracking below me. The jetty breaks and the message falls down into the water that is filled to the very rim with sharks - and I follow it!
Now I must grab the message as quickly as possible and then get out of the water, or I can forget the whole survival thing.

!1This is what the pirate wrote:
Fair thea wal, yee dump lubber!
Thanx for al teh stuf, I kan youse it reely wel.
If ye want too ged awey too, ye musst ownlee use the stones att the ruins!
Une of themm is carsted with a telleport spall! It wil bring ye too a FRIEND!!

P.S.: Naver drust a pirrate!! Hohoho!!!


!1My opinion:
I am dumb. Indeed. But at least I have a better orthography than the chap. That is a little consolation.
I will see if what he wrote about the stones is true. I am breathless of anticipation! It is all so exciting!

A map with a strange text. Perhaps I might find something if I strictly stick to the instructions and dig at the target spot!

The shape of a kind of hat and used for washing
from there on to the southwest until you are surrounded by fern
Henceforth southwards you go till the element of beginning
Northeast is the direction to your hard goal

I have found the treasure! A watch and a gold nugget! Awesome!
//~stoneitems
Trying to have myself teleported by the rock, I notice lightning and thunder. At closer sight, I see an inscription that reveals important facts that the pirate appears to have kept secret from me:

This worthy teleport stone 2050 XL of the quality brand Neptune needs the power of the water in order to perform long-range teleport. Please place 25 children of the sea at the stone before you use it.

... the rest is too weather-beaten to be made out. Hm.
