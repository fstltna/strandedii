I have met a cartographer in the village. He says that there are many treasures on the island. I do not know for sure wether he told me the truth or if it is just a trick of him to get people to buy his maps. Anyway, he said that he'd mark the positions of the treasures on his maps.

He furthermore offered me a simple deal:
I must catch 30 butterflies for him and in exchange, I will get a map. With branches and threads I can make a net to be able to catch the little things. There are said to be markedly many at the southern beach.

I have brought him the butterflies and received the map!

This is because I happen to visit the hemp chap at the other side of the island very often. We often have chats for hours. There is not much more to do here, after all.

One of the natives will brew me three potions, if I bring him a plum.
